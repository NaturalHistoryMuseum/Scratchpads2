# this library had to have code modified to be compatible with php 7.2
# and therefore attempting to manage its git repp
# within the main scratchpads repo raised the question about where
# to store that modification. give that the modification is
# related to scratchpads' production server environment,
# the answer to that question is to store the change in
# scratchpads' repo. Moreover the original developer may not
# necessarily want to access a push up to their repo of this
# backwards compatible change to obsolete php version. 
# Therefore with that decision to store in Scratchpads, that means
# disabling the project's own git (i.e. as a submodule), so the files
# will be removed and not tracked
